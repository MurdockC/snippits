				<h1>What Drivers are Saying</h1>
				<blockquote>"The dispatch does a good job at getting me the miles I need and the shop does a great job on making sure my truck is always working well." <cite>- Mike D.</cite></blockquote>
				<blockquote>"I never cease to be amazed by this company! THIS is the way a driver dreams of being treated each and every time they shop for a new job. Fair, honest, and above all, they treat me like I MATTER to them! I went home yesterday for the first time in two and a half weeks. My dispatcher called me and asked me when I wanted to roll again and then gave me a choice of a half a dozen different runs that would fit MY chosen date of departure!" <cite>- Kate F. - 97,000 accident-free miles</cite></blockquote>
