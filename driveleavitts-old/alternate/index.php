			<h2>Company Driver Pay</h2>
			<p>Leavitt's offers one of the best truck driver pay packages in the flatbed trucking industry</p>
			<ul class="arrow">
				<li>Pay is based on OTR experience and your productivity. We pay base mileage pay and also an additional CPM from .02 to .17 cpm for loads that are 61’ and longer. When drivers are top mileage performers they can add up to .04 cpm more to their wages. We call this “Dash for Cash” or D4C.</li>
				<li>How does this all add up? <strong>Leavitt’s Professional drivers can earn between $58k and $67k per year.</strong> When assigned to our OTR Fleet. Heavy Haul drivers are between $58k and $68K annually. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>(Keep in mind these are averages well above the ATA and TCA published wages for the national average for flatbed company drivers. They report numbers of 50k to 56k)</p>
