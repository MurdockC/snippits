	    <h1>About Leavitt’s Freight Service</h1>
	    <p>Leavitt’s Freight Service was established in 1958 by three brothers&mdash;Doug, Dean, and Dewey Leavitt&mdash;and is still privately held. The Company was founded on three philosophies: Honesty, Integrity, and Family.</p>
	    <p>At Leavitt’s, we see the trucking industry from a distinctive point of view... yours. We think like you because we used to be you. Many of our managers and office staff began their careers as drivers, including driver managers, the safety manager, training personnel, orientation instructors, maintenance personnel, and our recruiting staff. We still clearly remember what it's like to hop into that rig for the first time in a new job.</p>
	    <p>Leavitt’s provides you opportunities you won't find anywhere else: industry leading training, great pay and home time, top of the line equipment, and a home with the best drivers in flatbed trucking.</p>
	    <p>Thank you for considering Leavitt’s Freight Service for your next driving job.</p>

				<h1>What Drivers are Saying</h1>
				<blockquote>"The dispatch does a good job at getting me the miles I need and the shop does a great job on making sure my truck is always working well." <cite>- Mike D.</cite></blockquote>
				<blockquote>"I never cease to be amazed by this company! THIS is the way a driver dreams of being treated each and every time they shop for a new job. Fair, honest, and above all, they treat me like I MATTER to them! I went home yesterday for the first time in two and a half weeks. My dispatcher called me and asked me when I wanted to roll again and then gave me a choice of a half a dozen different runs that would fit MY chosen date of departure!" <cite>- Kate F. - 97,000 accident-free miles</cite></blockquote>
