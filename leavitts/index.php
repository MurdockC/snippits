						<p class="margin--lg">At Leavitt’s, we see the trucking industry from a distinct point of view: yours. We think like you because we used to be you. Lots of our office staff—from management to maintenance—started as drivers. We still clearly remember what it's like to hop into that rig for the first time.
		 At Leavitt’s, you’ll find exceptional training, above-average pay, and a job that’s been built on honesty, integrity, and family since 1958.</p>
